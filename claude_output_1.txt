The user wants me to create a web application for the St. Matthew Passion by Bach, segmented into 40 parts for Lent. Let me plan this out:

Create the project directory structure
Build a web app with:
Header image themed with Bach/Christian/Lent
Day carousel (40 days)
Song listings for each day
Player with German/English lyrics side by side
Clean, modern design
Let me first research the structure of St. Matthew Passion to properly segment it into 40 parts. The St. Matthew Passion (BWV 244) has 68 movements in Part I and Part II. I need to segment these into 40 roughly equal parts by duration.

I'll build this as a straightforward static web app with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Now I need to map out the complete movement list with durations so I can divide the 68 movements across the 40 Lenten days in a balanced way. I'm seeing the rest of the movements through the aria and recitatives, and realizing the total runtime is around 2 hours 45 minutes to 3 hours, which breaks down to roughly 4-4.5 minutes per movement across the 40 parts. Now I'm thinking about building this as a web app using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

For the audio, I'll embed YouTube recordings since the music is freely available there with timestamps. I'm planning to create a comprehensive data file with all 68 movements including German and English lyrics, then segment them into the 40-day structure.

The tech stack will be straightforward—a single-page application with vanilla JavaScript, CSS Grid and Flexbox for layout, and local storage to track which day the user is on. I'll start by setting up the project structure and building it out incrementally.

Now I'm compiling the complete movement list for the St. Matthew Passion with durations and proper numbering, though I realize different editions use different movement counts, so I'll stick with the standard 68-movement version.

Rather than trying to recall every movement perfectly from memory, I'll build out the web app structure first with the movement data I can compile, then use YouTube for the audio playback. For the 40-day breakdown, I'll distribute the 68 movements across the days, aiming for roughly 4-4.5 minutes per day, which works out to about 1-2 movements daily.

I'll set up the project with separate files for the HTML structure, styling, application logic, and the movement data with lyrics.

Let me look up the accurate movement listings with durations from a reliable source so I can properly segment them into the 40-day schedule.

Compiling the movement data... I'm noticing the numbering varies significantly across different editions of this work—some use 68 movements, others 78—so I should look up the standard structure and timings rather than guessing, then build the app with accurate data.

For the 40-day segmentation with roughly 170 minutes total, that's about 4.25 minutes per day, so I'll group the movements to hit that target. A simple HTML/CSS/JavaScript app makes the most sense here since it requires no build tools and the user can just open the file directly.

Building the app now...

Compiling the movement data with the standard 68-movement numbering and durations for the St. Matthew Passion. I realize the movement numbering I was using isn't quite right, so let me take a more systematic approach by searching for the accurate Bärenreiter edition listing first. I'll gather the complete movement information with timings, then build out the app structure while compiling the German lyrics and English translations, and I'll use YouTube timestamps for audio playback since that's the most straightforward way to handle the recordings.

Building this as a modern single-page app with CSS custom properties for theming and vanilla JavaScript for interactivity. For the header, I'll create a gradient-based design with decorative CSS elements rather than relying on external images.

Now I need to gather the actual movement data for the St. Matthew Passion. I know it has about 68 movements alternating between evangelist recitatives, character parts, arias, chorales, and large choruses, but I should search for the complete authoritative list with timings to ensure accuracy. Let me pull that data first, then build out the app structure and populate it. Continuing through the movements with their timings and translations, working through the recitatives and choruses that make up the narrative structure of Part One. I'm realizing this manual approach is getting unwieldy, so I'll search for the complete BWV 244 movement list online and then build the app with accurate data. For the audio, I'll embed YouTube recordings with timestamps for each movement, using a well-known recording like Richter or Gardiner. Now I'm outlining the full build process: gather the movement data for all 68 pieces with their durations and lyrics, organize them into the 40-day structure, then construct the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files to create an interactive carousel with playback controls. I'll start implementing right away, compiling the movement information as I go. thing. For the design, I'm going with deep purples and golds to capture that Lenten aesthetic, paired with clean serif headings and responsive layout. Since I can't generate actual images, I'll create a striking CSS-based header instead—a gradient background with a decorative cross motif and subtle musical elements that evoke Bach and the sacred theme.

Now I'm ready to start building. I'll set up the project structure, pull accurate movement data from reliable sources, and construct the full application.

I'll build this step by step. Let me start by creating the project structure and researching the movement data for accurate segmentation.

Based on my web search results, I was unable to find a complete detailed list of all 68 movements of Bach's St Matthew Passion with individual durations for each movement. The search results confirm that the Neue Bach-Ausgabe (NBA, New Bach Edition) divides the piece into 68 movements, and that the St Matthew Passion features 68 different musical numbers, divided into two acts, or "parts": Part One featuring 29 numbers, and Part Two 39 numbers.

However, the search results do not contain a comprehensive table or listing showing the titles, types, and individual durations (in minutes) for all 68 movements. The closest information available indicates that most performances last between two-and-a-half to three hours, and the overall duration is 164 minutes, but these are aggregate figures rather than movement-by-movement breakdowns.

To obtain the specific movement-by-movement list with durations you're looking for, you would likely need to consult:
- The full NBA (Neue Bach-Ausgabe) edition score
- Detailed liner notes from specific recordings
- Specialized Bach research databases or academic sources

I apologize that I couldn't locate this detailed information through available web sources.

Based on the search results, I found information about Karl Richter's famous 1958 St. Matthew Passion recording:

Karl Richter's 1958 St. Matthew Passion recording has a total duration of 3 hours 18 minutes and 41 seconds, featuring soloists Irmgard Seefried (soprano), Antoine Fahberg (soprano), Hertha Töpper (alto), Ernst Haefliger (tenor), and Kieth Engen and Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau (bass).

The search results include partial tracklist information from a digital audio source showing individual movement timings. For example, some movements include No. 46 with a timing of 01:40, No. 45 at 02:44, and the aria "Aus Liebe will mein Heiland sterben" (No. 49) at 04:29.

However, the search results do not contain a complete, detailed tracklist with timings for all movements of this recording. To obtain the full movement-by-movement breakdown with individual timings, you would need to consult the complete CD booklet or a detailed discography database that lists all movements (typically numbered 1-78 for the St. Matthew Passion) with their respective durations.

Based on my search results, I can provide you with key information about the St. Matthew Passion BWV 244:

## Structure and Movements

The Bach-Werke-Verzeichnis (BWV, Bach Works Catalog) divides the work into 78 numbers (vocal movements), while the Neue Bach-Ausgabe (NBA, New Bach Edition) divides the piece into 68 movements.

The work is composed in two parts, that were to be performed before and after the sermon of that service. Part I covers the events until the arrest of Jesus and Part II concludes with his burial and the sealing of his grave.

## Duration

The St. Matthew Passion is divided into two parts, and its performance takes somewhat less than three hours.

## Notable Movements

The chorus "O Haupt voll Blut und Wunden" ("O Sacred Head Now Wounded"), stands as 54th of the 68 sections. Other notable movements include the alto air "Buss und Reu" ("Guilt and Pain"; section 6).

## Limitations

Unfortunately, the search results do not contain a complete tracklist with individual movement durations for Spotify or Apple Music. Complete tracklists vary depending on the recording and conductor, as each performer takes different tempos and may make different interpretive choices. To find this information, I'd recommend checking Spotify, Apple Music, or AllMusic directly for specific recordings, as different versions will have different movement listings and timings.

Look - Where? - upon our guilt;
See Him, out of love and grace,
Bearing the wood of the cross Himself!

O Lamb of God, innocent,
Slaughtered on the trunk of the cross,
Always found patient,
However much Thou wert despised.
All sin hast Thou borne,
Else we must needs despair.
Have mercy on us, O Jesus!`

At the last came two false witnesses, and said: This fellow said, I am able to destroy the temple of God, and to build it in three days.
And the high priest arose, and said unto Him: Answerest Thou nothing? What is it which these witness against Thee?
But Jesus held His peace.`

Es war aber allda Maria Magdalena und die andere Maria, die satzten sich gegen das Grab.
Des andern Tages, der da folget nach dem Rüsttage, kamen die Hohenpriester und Pharisäer sämtlich zu Pilato und sprachen: Herr, wir haben gedacht, daß dieser Verführer sprach, da er noch lebete: Ich will nach dreien Tagen wieder auferstehen. Darum befiehl, daß man das Grab verwahre bis an den dritten Tag, auf daß nicht seine Jünger kommen und stehlen ihn und sagen zu dem Volk: Er ist von den Toten auferstanden; und werde der letzte Betrug ärger denn der erste.

Now the next day, that followed the day of the preparation, the chief priests and Pharisees came together unto Pilate, saying: Sir, we remember that that deceiver said, while He was yet alive, After three days I will rise again. Command therefore that the sepulchre be made sure until the third day, lest His disciples come by night, and steal Him away, and say unto the people, He is risen from the dead: so the last error shall be worse than the first.
Pilate said unto them: Ye have a watch: go your way, make it as sure as ye can.

I notice I have 71 movements in my data (numbered 1-71), which is more than the standard 68. Let me re-examine. The issue is that my numbering doesn't match the standard NBA numbering. In the NBA, the movements are numbered 1-68. But in the older BWV numbering (Breitkopf), they go up to 78.

Let me reconsider. The NBA numbering has 68 movements across Part I (1-35) and Part II (36-78 in old numbering, but 36-68 in NBA). Actually, I think I've been mixing up numbering systems.

So I'm seeing the discrepancy now—my 71 movements split into 37 for Part One and 34 for Part Two doesn't align with the NBA standard of 29 and 39 respectively. The confusion stems from different editions using different numbering schemes: the NBA uses 68 total, while the older Breitkopf edition goes up to 78.

Rather than getting caught up in which numbering system to follow, what matters is that I have all the essential movements organized correctly—the opening chorus, Peter's denial with "Erbarme dich," Judas's remorse, and the burial through final chorus. Now I need to verify I'm capturing every movement and properly distributing them across the 40 days.

Continuing through the list, I'm tracking movements 6 through 24, which covers the Bethany scene, the anointing, Judas's betrayal agreement, the Last Supper preparations and events, and into Gethsemane with the prayer and disciples' responses.

Now I'm realizing I need to verify the structure of Part One's ending—the traditional closing should be the chorale fantasia "O Mensch, bewein dein Sünde groß," but I'm not seeing it in my current sequence. Let me check against the 1736 revised version to make sure I have the correct movements listed.

Looking at the NBA numbering, Part I runs from movements 1-29, with that elaborate chorale fantasia as the final movement. My list seems to extend beyond that, so I should consolidate and make sure everything aligns properly for the 40-day segmentation I'm planning. I'm realizing I need to step back and focus on what actually matters for the app—making sure all the music is included, dividing it into roughly 40 equal segments, and pairing each with the proper German and English text. Rather than getting caught up in reconciling different numbering systems, I should reorganize my data by adding the missing movements and fixing the structure to work for the 40-day format.

Now I'm calculating the total duration by adding up all the movement lengths to see how to distribute them evenly across the days. Now I'm compiling the performance metrics from entries 48 through 71, then summing everything up to get the total. Compiling the calculation results...

I'm finishing up the remaining line items and then summing everything to get a total of about 169 minutes. That breaks down to roughly 4.2 minutes per day, so now I need to organize this into proper 40-day segments.

I'm starting to map out the daily breakdown—the opening chorus takes up most of day one at 7.5 minutes, then I'm grouping shorter pieces together to hit that target. But I'm running into a problem where some items like the aria are too long to pair efficiently, so I need to reconsider how to distribute them across the days. but the aria is indivisible.

Actually, for a devotional, having some days a bit longer is fine. Let me reconsider. The arias and big choruses are 5-7 minutes each and can't really be split. So some days will be shorter and some longer. That's OK.

Let me try again more carefully:

Day 1: [1] = 7.5 (Opening Chorus)
Day 2: [2,3,4,5] = 3.0 (The Plot)
Day 3: [6,7,8] = 4.0 (Anointing at Bethany)
Day 4: [9,10] = 6.75 (Grief and Repentance)
Day 5: [11,12] = 6.5 (Judas's Betrayal)
Day 6: [13,14,15] = 3.5 (Last Supper)
Day 7: [16,17] = 3.5 (Institution + Chorale)
Day 8: [18,19] = 3.5 (Mount of Olives)
Day 9: [20,21] = 5.0 (Gethsemane + O Schmerz)
Day 10: [22] = 5.5 (Watching with Jesus)
Day 11: [23,24] = 3.5 (Thy Will Be Done)
Day 12: [25] = 3.0 (Betrayal) - continuing to map out the remaining sections through the Passion narrative. I think "Erbarme dich" works better as its own meditation piece given how iconic it is. Let me restructure this more systematically, mapping out each day with the movements and their durations to create a balanced devotional arc. Continuing through the passion narrative, I'm mapping out the remaining movements—the sword incident and Peter's denial form a substantial section, followed by the powerful "Erbarme dich" aria at the emotional peak, then Judas's remorse and the final chorale fragments leading into the crucifixion scene. Continuing to map out the remaining days, I'm assigning the later movements around the crucifixion and resurrection—the scourging, crown of thorns, and death of Jesus each get their own space, with "Come, sweet cross" running a bit long at 7.5 minutes, and I'm still working through how the final movements land across the last few days.

I'm realizing I've only mapped 38 days when I need 40, so I need to split some of the longer movements to stretch the schedule properly. Looking at the total runtime of about 169 minutes across 40 days, that averages to roughly 4 minutes per day, which means I should redistribute the longer pieces more evenly. Looking at how the schedule is shaping up, I'm seeing a lot of awkward short segments scattered throughout—Days 2, 3, 4, 7, 8, and 9 are all under three minutes, which breaks up the flow. Rather than forcing everything into a rigid 4.2-minute average, I think it makes more sense to just divide the movements into 40 roughly equal sections and let the daily lengths vary naturally—some days might be two or three minutes, others could stretch to seven, and that's perfectly fine for a devotional format where listeners can adjust their engagement as needed. I'm realizing some of these movements are too long for a single day and need to be broken up differently. Let me try a more flexible grouping that respects how the musical sections naturally cluster together, rather than forcing them into equal daily chunks. I'm mapping out the remaining days of the Passion narrative, tracking each section's duration and thematic focus—from the betrayal and arrest through Peter's denial, culminating in the plea for mercy and the turn toward repentance as morning approaches. Moving through the passion narrative, I'm tracking the crucifixion sequence from the crown of thorns through the burial and sealing of the tomb, with the longest section being the burial itself at nine minutes.

Now I'm reconsidering the segmentation—some days are quite short while others stretch longer, so I'm experimenting with redistributing the material. I'm trying to balance Day 25 by combining it with adjacent sections and breaking up the lengthy Day 37 into smaller chunks, though this creates some awkward pacing with Day 26 becoming too brief. I need to find a better arrangement that keeps the segments more consistent in length. I'm going to finalize the 40-day structure now, mapping out the remaining days with their corresponding sections and durations. Continuing through the passion narrative, I'm mapping out the remaining days leading up to and through the crucifixion—from the morning council and Pilate's judgment through the scourging and into the final moments, with each day's hymns and their corresponding verse ranges and durations. I've mapped out all 40 days with a total runtime around 168 minutes, averaging about 4.2 minutes per day, which feels balanced. Now I'm reconsidering a couple of the longer segments—Day 10 and Day 30 are pushing toward 8 minutes—so I'm exploring whether I can split those into smaller, more manageable pieces.

If I break Day 10 into two shorter segments and redistribute Day 11, I'd end up needing 41 days total, which means I'd have to consolidate elsewhere. I'm looking at merging some of the shorter adjacent days to keep the overall structure intact, like combining the Gethsemane and O Grief sections, or grouping several consecutive movements together to hit a more balanced length. Continuing through the Passion narrative, I'm mapping out the remaining days with sections covering Gethsemane, the arrest, trial before the Sanhedrin, and the mocking—each with their corresponding verses and durations to fill the 40-day structure. Continuing through the passion narrative, I'm tracking the remaining days of the devotional—from the scourging through to the crucifixion and its aftermath, with each passage assigned its duration and thematic focus.

I realize I'm one day short of the 40-day structure, so I'm splitting day 29 to separate the flesh and blood imagery from the cross itself, which gives me the full count I need. Now I'm reorganizing the schedule to confirm all 40 days are accounted for, starting from the opening chorus and moving through the plot and anointing at Bethany. Continuing through the passion narrative, I'm mapping out the remaining sections covering the arrest through Pilate's judgment, with varying emotional intensities ranging from the stark betrayal and denial moments to the more dramatically charged scenes like the verdict and mocking. Continuing through the passion narrative, I'm mapping out the final days leading to the resurrection—days 31 through 40 cover the crucifixion at Golgotha, Jesus's death, the tearing of the veil, and the entombment, with each day assigned specific verses and corresponding hymn titles and durations.

Now I'm reconsidering the pacing of the earlier days. Day 29's recitative is quite brief at just over a minute, so I'm folding it into Day 28 to create a longer combined movement covering the Crown of Thorns through to the Cross itself, then opening up space by splitting Day 4 into two separate days with distinct hymns. I'm working through the revised structure to ensure the overall arc flows properly across all 40 days. I'm continuing to map out the remaining days of the musical, assigning scenes to each day and calculating their total durations through the final scenes leading up to the crucifixion. Continuing through the remaining days of the devotional, I'm tracking the readings and their corresponding time allocations—Day 26 wraps up at 5.0 minutes with "Out of Love," then moving into the passion narrative with passages on the scourging, tears, and crown of thorns, with longer segments like "Come, Sweet Cross" taking 7.5 minutes, before concluding with the crucifixion accounts and their reflections.

Now I've got the full 40-day structure locked in. I need to update the data file and then tackle the audio playback—I'm thinking about using YouTube embeds for each movement rather than trying to embed a single complete recording.

The challenge is figuring out the best approach: I could generate search links for each movement, embed specific videos from a project like the Netherlands Bach Society's "All of Bach," or use timestamps within a complete recording. For the MVP, search links seem simplest since they don't depend on specific video IDs that might become unavailable, though I'm realizing YouTube doesn't actually support embedded search functionality the way I was imagining. I'll keep the MVP focused: YouTube search links for each movement, lyrics displayed in German and English side by side, and a clean interface. Now I need to structure the data file with the 40-day segmentation and build out the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. For the YouTube integration, I'll create a function that generates search URLs dynamically for each movement based on its title and number. Building the search URL...

I'm settling on a straightforward approach: create the data structure with all movements, build the HTML and CSS for a two-column lyrics layout, and add a simple YouTube search link for each movement rather than trying to embed specific videos. This keeps things flexible and lets users find their preferred recordings. I'm uncertain whether YouTube's search-based embed still works reliably, so I'll stick with direct search links for now and move forward with building the app rather than getting stuck on this detail. Let me start writing out the files—I'll begin with the data structure, then move through the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Now let me rewrite the data file with proper 40-day segmentation and then build the full app. Let me check the research agent first.

Read a1be6f2.output
The research agent is still working. Let me proceed with building the app - I have comprehensive movement data already. Let me now create all the application files. I'll build them in parallel.

### Important notes on numbering

The file uses the **consolidated 68-movement numbering** commonly found in vocal scores and CD track listings. Some editions (notably the Neue Bach-Ausgabe critical edition) use a sub-numbering system (e.g., 26a/26b, 33a/33b/33c) which yields a higher total count (up to 78 sub-numbers). The content is identical -- only the granularity of numbering differs. In this file, short turba chorus interjections that are embedded within a recitative narrative are included within the parent recitative's entry rather than given separate numbers.

### Caveats

Since web search and fetch tools were unavailable, this data is compiled from my training knowledge of the standard scholarly editions and well-known recordings. The German titles, English translations, scoring, and durations are drawn from standard sources (Barenreiter vocal score, Gardiner/Herreweghe/Suzuki recordings). I recommend cross-checking specific details against a printed vocal score or a reference like the Bach Digital catalog if absolute precision is needed for a published application.</result>
